# pushkind-order

`pushkind-order` is a Pushkind service focused on uploading and editing product lists while creating, tracking, and managing orders. The project is powered by Rust, Actix Web, Diesel, and Tera on top of Bootstrap 5.3 for the frontend.

## Features

- Actix Web server with identity and session management
- SQLite database access via Diesel ORM
- REST API endpoints for managing products and orders
- Tera templates for server-rendered pages

## Running locally

1. Install [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).
2. Set the required environment variables:
   - `DATABASE_URL` (e.g. `app.db`)
   - `SECRET_KEY` for session encryption
   - `AUTH_SERVICE_URL` a url of the authentication service
   - Optional: `PORT`, `ADDRESS`, `DOMAIN`
3. Run database migrations with `diesel migration run` (requires `diesel-cli`).
4. Start the server:

```bash
cargo run
```

The service listens on `http://127.0.0.1:8080` by default.

## Testing
